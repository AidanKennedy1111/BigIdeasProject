# BigIdeasProject
Part 1

Your README should have, at least, the three parts that we discussed in lecture. Read over other READMEs to get an idea of what else you should include: you should definitely mention your code of conduct in the details of how to contribute to your project, and you should include how your software is licensed in your installation and use section. Anything else is up to you!

In this python program the user is asked to input their name and age and it will return a comment on their age, for example if you are older than 70 our program will return, "You are a senior citizen."
